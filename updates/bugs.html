<h1>BUGS!</h1>

<h2>Not the glitch kind!</h2>

<p>This is another MASSIVE update that adds mobs to the game! Every biome now has an exclusive bug (5 in total) that has unique move, attack, and scurry patterns! There are also 4 new items, 2 of them having new abilities!

What’s Added? (ONLY LOOK IF YOU WANT SPOILERS!)

New mob: Ladybug
Ladybugs are passive mobs that run when you tap them and are found in the forest! They drop ladybug wings and leaves!

New mob: Caterpillar
Caterpillars are passive-aggressive mobs that spew spit at you when you hit them! They drop nectar, an item used to snooze mobs from going into scurry/attack mode for one minute! These spawn in the tulip patch.

New mob: Stink Bug
Stink bugs are similar to the caterpillar and spawn in the swamp. They are passive-aggressive meaning they go into attack mode when you hit them and drop toxic gas.

New mob: Desert Cobra
These mobs are aggressive and spawn in the desert. This means if you get to close to them they automatically start attacking you! They charge at you and infect you with venom. These mobs drop the golden leaf item.

New mob: Snow Spider
This mob is a passive-spawner and lives in the snowy plains. It runs around the plains making webs that damage you if you step in them as well as temporarily slowing you. If you hit them, they leave a massive trail of webs! They don’t take much hits to destroy though! Webs have a small chance to spawn as a crystal web, which is a legendary item used to destroy every web in sight. Snow Spiders may drop blue dye when killed.

In total, there are 5 new mobs and 4 new items explained above!

Settings are now added to help decrease lag or add cool effects back into the game that were removed due to lag! Choose these according to your device.

This update is massive and adds so much depth to the game!</p>
